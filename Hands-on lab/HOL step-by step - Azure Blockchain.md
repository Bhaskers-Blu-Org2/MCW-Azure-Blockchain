# Azure Blockchain hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things (IoT) Audit Solution using Azure blockchain services. You will collect device telemetry using Azure IoT Hub and use Ethereum blockchain ledger to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be validated through the Smart Contracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build a solution to deploy and configure Azure Blockchain Workbench, write and deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity, and integrate both IoT and the blockchain ledger into a single solution.

### Overview

In this lab, students will deploy a Blockchain solution using the Azure Blockchain Workbench. They will then configure authentication and authorization of multiple users using Azure AD. Then a Smart Contract to track and enforce compliance of a package in the Supply Chain will be implemented within the Blockchain written in Solidity. Finally, the student will create an instance of the Smart Contract on the Blockchain, go through the business workflow defined in the Smart Contract. The student will also feed IoT device sensor telemetry into the Blockchain Smart Contract to validate compliance of the contract using a simulated device account.

## Solution architecture

    ![The File menu is highlighted and open, with the Open Folder menu item highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image80.png "Select the Open Folder menu item")

2. In the **Open Folder** dialog, select the **C:/HOL** folder. If the folder does not exist yet, please create it.

    ![The HOL folder is selected, and the Select Folder button is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image81.png "Select the HOL folder on the C drive")

3. Expand the **Explorer** pane, then hover over the **HOL** folder, and click the **New File** button.

    ![The Explorer icon in the left-side menu is highlighted and labeled 1, and the New File menu item for the HOL folder is highlighted and labeled 2.](images/lab-guide/image82.png "Create a new file within the HOL folder")

4. Type in **TelemetryCompliance.sol** as the file name.

    ![The newly created TelemetryCompoliance.sol file is displayed.](images/lab-guide/image83.png "New file has been created")

5. Open the **TelemetryCompliance.sol** file, then add the following line to the top of the file. This first line specifies the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.20 or newer that does not break functionality up to, but not including version 0.5.0. This is to ensure the Smart Contract does not behave differently with a new compiler version.

    ```
    pragma solidity ^0.4.25;
    ```

7. Next, add the beginning of the Smart Contract. The type name for this contract will be TelemetryCompliance.

    ```
    contract TelemetryCompliance
    {
        // insert smart contract code here
    }
    ```

8. Next, the functionality of the Smart Contract needs to be filled out. Start this by adding the following **enum StateType** definition within the **TelemetryCompliance** class.

    ```
    enum StateType {
        Creating,
        Created,
        TransitionRequestPending,
        InTransit,
        FinalDelivery,
        Completed,
        OutOfCompliance
    }
    ```

9. Add the **State** property of type **StateType**. This will be used through-out the lifetime of the Smart Contract to store the appropriate state of the contact.

    ```
    StateType public State;
    ```

10. Add the following additional properties to the Smart Contract. These properties will be used to track the different individuals who will be participating in the workflow.

    ```
    address public InitiatingCounterparty;
    address public Counterparty;
    address public PreviousCounterparty;
    address public RequestedCounterparty;
    address public Device;
    address public SupplyChainOwner;
    address public SupplyChainObserver;
    ```

    The "**Counterparty**" properties that were added are used to reflect the different individuals' organizations that have had, do currently     have, or are about to have possession of a package.

    There is also a "**Device**" property to provide telemetry information on humidity and temperature which will be evaluated by the Smart Contract. The contract is setup so that this ca work with both a real device and Azure IoT Hub, or a person simulating the device as a logged in user.

    The "**SupplyChainOwner**" represents the organization that is shipping the package through the supply chain.

    The "**SupplyChainObserver**" represents an organization that does not participate in the supply chain but may be monitoring it. An example of an observer could be a government agency.

    >**Note**: The SupplyChainObserver is included in the properties of the Smart Contract, but it's not being implemented in this lab.

11. Add the following properties to be used to enforce the package will be maintained in an environment with minimum and maximum threshold readings (min and max) for both Temperature and Humidity. There are also properties that record the last reported values and the timestamp for the last sensor update; as a Unix epoch date value versus a formatted date and time.

    ```
    int public MinHumidity;
    int public MaxHumidity;
    int public MinTemperature;
    int public MaxTemperature;
    int public LastHumidity;
    int public LastTemperature;
    uint public LastSensorUpdateTimestamp;
    ```

12. Next, add some properties to provide information on the compliance status of the contract. The **ComplianceStatus** property will store whether the monitored sensor values are out of compliance. The **enum** **SensorType** will be used along with the **ComplianceSensorType** property to store information on the specific sensor reading recorded. The **ComplianceSensorReading** property will store the actual value of the sensor reading. Also, the **ComplianceDetail** property will store additional information about the compliance.

    ```
    enum SensorType { None, Humidity, Temperature }
    bool public ComplianceStatus;
    string public ComplianceDetail;
    SensorType public ComplianceSensorType;
    int public ComplianceSensorReading;
    ```

13. To start adding the functionality of Smart Contract, next, add the following **Constructor** to the **TelemetryCompliance** Smart Contract:

    ```
    constructor(address device, address supplyChainOwner, address supplyChainObserver, int minHumidity, int maxHumidity, int minTemperature, int maxTemperature) public
    {
        ComplianceStatus = true;
        ComplianceSensorReading = -1;
        InitiatingCounterparty = msg.sender;
        Counterparty = InitiatingCounterparty;
        Device = device;
        SupplyChainOwner = supplyChainOwner;
        SupplyChainObserver = supplyChainObserver;
        MinHumidity = minHumidity;
        MaxHumidity = maxHumidity;
        MinTemperature = minTemperature;
        MaxTemperature = maxTemperature;
        State = StateType.Created;
    }
    ```

    The constructor function has the same name as the Smart Contract and is called when the contract is created. The contract assumes the individual creating the contract is the **Counterparty** and will also assign this individual to the **InitiatingCounterparty**.

    Initially, the constructor set the **ComplianceStatus** to **true** for meeting compliance, and the **ComplianceSensorReading** to **-1** since no sensor readings have occurred yet. It then sets the **State** to indicated it was just **Created**.

14. Next, add the **IngestTelemetry** function to the Smart Contract. This function will receive the device telemetry information from sensors on the package. The parameters of this function are the **humidity** and **temperature** to receive data from sensors, and the third is the **timestamp** parameter is an integer representing a Unix epoch time for when the sensor information was collected.

    The IngestTelemetry function performs the following actions:

    a.  It verifies the sender of the telemetry is the Device that's assigned to the contract.

    b.  It confirms the contract is in a state where it is interested in receiving telemetry information; aka the contract State is not "Completed" or "Out of Compliance".

    c.  It assigns the values to their associated properties; LastHumidity, LastTemperature, and LastSensorUpdateTimestamp.

    d.  It checks the Temperature and Humidity telemetry values to identify if they are out of established ranges when the contract was created. If telemetry is not within the min and max values, then the contract will be recorded as "Out of Compliance" by setting the ComplianceStatus property to false. It will also record which telemetry has caused the compliance issue.

    >**Note**: The sensor data may be collected continuously, but data will not be sent to the contract continuously. Instead, it will be sent when business rules have identified that the data falls outside the acceptable ranges. Not reflected in the lab, is the scenario where information is also sent once per x, where x is a time interval such as 5 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, etc.

    ```
    function IngestTelemetry(int humidity, int temperature, uint timestamp) public
    {
        if (Device != msg.sender || State == StateType.OutOfCompliance || State == StateType.Completed)
        {
            revert();
        }

        LastHumidity = humidity;
        LastTemperature = temperature;
        LastSensorUpdateTimestamp = timestamp;

        if (humidity > MaxHumidity || humidity < MinHumidity)
        {
            ComplianceSensorType = SensorType.Humidity;
            ComplianceSensorReading = humidity;
            ComplianceDetail = 'Humidity value out of range.';
            ComplianceStatus = false;
        }
        else if (temperature > MaxTemperature || temperature < MinTemperature)
        {
            ComplianceSensorType = SensorType.Temperature;
            ComplianceSensorReading = temperature;
            ComplianceDetail = 'Temperature value out of range.';
            ComplianceStatus = false;
        }

        if (ComplianceStatus == false)
        {
            State = StateType.OutOfCompliance;
        }
    }
    ```

15. Add the **RequestTransferResponsiblity** function to the Smart Contract. This function will manage making requests for another party to take responsibility for an item. This function performs an evaluation whether the address associated with the request is the current *Counterparty*, and the contract is in a state where a transfer is possible.

    If the appropriate context is not in place, it will flag an error to the caller using the *"revert()"* method.

    If the appropriate context is in place, then it sets the *RequestedCounterparty* property to the value of the *newCounterparty* parameter.

    ```
    function RequestTransferResponsibility( address newCounterparty ) public
    {
        if (Counterparty != msg.sender || (State != StateType.Created && State != StateType.InTransit) || newCounterparty == Device || newCounterparty == SupplyChainObserver)
        {
            revert();
        }
        RequestedCounterparty = newCounterparty;
        State = StateType.TransitionRequestPending;
    }
    ```

16. Next, add the **AcceptTransferResponsibility** function. This function manages the process of the requested party to acknowledge a transfer of responsibility of an item. This function performs an evaluation whether the address associated with the request is the current *RequestedCounterparty*, and the contract is in a state of *TransitionRequestPending*.

    If the appropriate context is not in place, it will flag an error to the caller using the "*revert()*" method.

    If the appropriate context is in place, it sets the *PreviousCounterparty* property to the value of the current *CounterParty* property. It then sets the current *CounterParty* to the *RequestedCounterparty* that has accepted the transfer of responsibility. It transitions the state to "*InTransit*" and resets the *RequestedCounterparty* to 0x0.

    ```
    function AcceptTransferResponsibility() public
    {
        if (RequestedCounterparty != msg.sender || State != StateType.TransitionRequestPending)
        {
            revert();
        }

        PreviousCounterparty = Counterparty;
        Counterparty = RequestedCounterparty;
        RequestedCounterparty = 0x0;
        State = StateType.InTransit;
    }
    ```

17. Add the **TakeFinalDelivery** function. This function is used to identify when the final delivery of the package has taken place. The function performs an evaluation to determine whether the address associated with the request to terminate the function is the current *Counterparty* and that the package is in the state of "*InTransit*"

    If not, it will flag an error to the caller using the "*revert()*" method.

    If it is the *Counterparty*, it then sets the state of the contract, via the **State** property, to **FinalDelivery**.

    ```
    function TakeFinalDelivery() public
    {
        if (Counterparty != msg.sender || State != StateType.InTransit)
        {
            revert();
        }

        State = StateType.FinalDelivery;
    }
    ```

18. Add the **Complete** function. This function allows the **SupplyChainOwner** to sign off on the contract as being complete when the contract is in the final delivery state. This function confirms that the caller is the *SupplyChainOwner* and that the contract is in the *FinalDelivery* state.

    If not, it will flag an error to the caller using the "*revert()*" method.

    If it is, then it sets the *State* of the contract to *Completed*, sets the *PreviousCounterparty* property to the current value of the *Counterparty* property, and then resets the value of the current *Counterparty*.

    ```
    function Complete() public
    {
        if (SupplyChainOwner != msg.sender || State != StateType.FinalDelivery)
        {
            revert();
        }

        PreviousCounterparty = Counterparty;
        Counterparty = 0x0;
        State = StateType.Completed;
    }
    ```

19. Save the file.

    ![The File menu is selected and open, and the Save menu item is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image84.png "Save the file")

### Task 2: Create the Configuration Files

In this task, you will create the configuration file that contains metadata on the Smart Contract so the Blockchain Workbench will be
able to generate an application for the contract.

1. With **Visual Studio Code** still open to the **C:/HOL** folder, create a new file named **TelemetryCompliance.json**.

    ![The newly created TelemetryCompliance.json file is displayed and highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image85.png "Create a new file named TelemetryCompliance.json")

2. Open the **TelemetryCompliance.json** file, then add the following JSON object code:

    ```
    {
    "ApplicationName": "TelemetryCompliance",
    "DisplayName": "Telemetry Compliance",
    "Description": "",
    "ApplicationRoles": [
        {
            "Name": "Admin",
            "Description": "Admin"
        },
        {
            "Name": "User",
            "Description": "User"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Auditor",
            "Description": "Auditor"
        }
    ],
    "Workflows": [
        {
            "Name": "TelemetryCompliance",
            "DisplayName": "Telemetry Compliance",
            "Description": "",
            "Initiators": ["Admin","User"],
            "StartState": "Creating",
            "Properties": [

            ],
            "Constructor": {
                "Parameters": [
                ]
            },
            "Functions": [

            ],
            "States": [

            ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. Within the **"Properties"** object, add the following JSON to define the metadata for the Properties of the TelemetryCompliance smart contract. This will create mappings for the properties defined in the Smart Contract.

    There are multiple items that can be reflected by an address in a Solidity smart contract, such as a user or contract, so Blockchain Workbench provides custom data types to help to determine how to interact with the contract appropriately. The *InitiatingCounterparty*, *Counterparty*, *PreviousCounterparty*, *RequestedCounterparty*, *Device*, *SupplyChainOwner*, and *SupplyChainObserver* properties are all defined as a "*user*" type.

    Additional properties for tracking the sensor rules and compliance
    details are also defined here, with a 1:1 mapping with what was seen
    in the Smart Contract definition created previously.

    ```
                {

    ```

4. Modify the following metadata JSON within the **"Constructor"** object. This provides a metadata definition of the Constructor for the Smart Contract to Blockchain Workbench.

    The **TelemetryCompliance** contract has seven parameters for its constructor. Three properties (*device, supplyChainOwner,* and *supplyChainObserver*) are specified as a "*user*" type. This provides context to Blockchain Workbench that it can provide to downstream clients and systems.

    The contract is measuring compliance of Counterparties maintaining the item in an environment by evaluating telemetry from two types of sensors (temperature and humidity). The remaining four parameters in the constructor capture the minimum and maximum allowed ranges of sensor readings allowed to be considered in compliance (*minHumidity*, *maxHumidity*, *minTemperature*, *maxTemperature*).

    ```
            "Constructor": {
                "Parameters": [

                    {
                        "Name": "device",
                        "Description": "...",
                        "DisplayName": "Device",
                        "Type": {
                            "Name": "user"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "Name": "supplyChainOwner",
                        "Description": "...",
                        "DisplayName": "SupplyChain Owner",
                        "Type": {
                            "Name": "user"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "Name": "supplyChainObserver",
                        "Description": "...",

                            "Name": "user"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "Name": "minHumidity",
                        "Description": "...",
                        "DisplayName": "Minimum Humidity",
                        "Type": {
                            "Name": "int"
                        }
                    },

                        "Description": "...",
                        "DisplayName": "Maximum Humidity",
                        "Type": {
                            "Name": "int"
                        }
                    },

                    }

                ]

            },
    ```

5. Add the following metadata JSON to the **"Functions"** object that defines the *Functions* in the Smart Contract:

    As was seen in the smart contract, there are five functions: "*IngestTelemetry*," "*RequestTransferResponsibility*," "*AcceptTransferResponsibility*," "*TakeFinalDelivery*," and "*Complete*."

    As was seen earlier in this lab exercise, the type of "*user*" is assigned to provide context to Blockchain Workbench about the type of address needed for the action.

    If a function has no parameters, the parameters will be represented by an open and closed curly brace.

    ```
           "Functions": [

                {
                    "Name": "IngestTelemetry",

                        }
                    ]
                },

                            "Type": {
                                "Name": "user"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "Name": "AcceptTransferResponsibility",

                    ]
                }
            ]
    ```

6. Add the following metadata JSON to the "**States**" object that defines the *Functions* in the Smart Contract:

    ```
            "States": [

7. Save the file.

### Task 3: Deploy the Smart Contract

1. Open a new browser / tab and navigate to the **Blockchain Workbench Web Client** application.

2. Login to the Blockchain Workbench web application using the same account you logged in to your Azure Subscription with, and previously configured as an *Administrator* for the app.

3. Click the **+ New** tile button to begin creating a new Blockchain application.

    ![The New button is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image87.png "Create a new Blockchain application")

    >**Note**: If you do not see the "+ New" tile button, then please go back and verify you configured / setup the Administrator user permissions correctly.

4. On the **New Application** form, click the **Browse** button.

    ![The Browse button for uploading the contract configuration json is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image88.png "Upload contract configuration json")

5. In the **Open** dialog, locate and select the **TelemetryCompliance.json** file, then click **Open**.

    ![The TelemetryCompliance.json file is highlighted within the HOL folder.](images/lab-guide/open-file-telemetrycompliance-json.png "Select the TelemetryCompliance.json file")

    >**Note**: When uploading the JSON file, it will be validated. If there are any errors in the file, they will display in a red box directly below the **Browse** button. If you have questions about the JSON Schema for Azure Blockchain Workbench, then refer to the [Azure Blockchain Workbench configuration reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain-workbench/blockchain-workbench-configuration-overview) article within the documentation.

    >![Errors in the uploaded json file are displayed.](images/lab-guide/telemetrycompliance-json-file-errors-display-screenshot.png "Errors in the uploaded json file are displayed")
    >
    >You can also use the following tools to check the files for errors:
    >
    >- Test the Solidity (.sol) Smart Contract source code using the remix IDE available at <http://remix.ethereum.org>.
    >
    >- Test the JSON file using <http://jsoneditoronline.org>.

6. Click on the **Browse** button to **UPLOAD THE CONTRACT CODE (.sol, .zip)**, then choose the **TelemetryCompliance.sol** Solidity source code file for the Smart Contract.

    ![The Browse button for uploading the contract code is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/image89.png "Upload the contract code")

7. Once file validation passed for the uploaded files, click **Deploy** to deploy the Blockchain Application to the Azure Blockchain Workbench.

    ![The Deploy button is highlighted.](images/lab-guide/blockchain-workbench-deploy-application-button.png "The Deploy button is highlighted")

8. Once the Deployment is complete, you should see the **Telemetry Compliance** Blockchain Application in the list of Applications.

    ![The newly created Blockchain application is displayed.](images/lab-guide/blockchain-application-deployment-success.png "The newly created Blockchain application is displayed")

    > **NOTE:** The Blockchain application displays its version number; in this case it's v1.0. This versioning features allows for the contract to be updated with new versions as requirements changes over time.

## Exercise 5: Assign Users to Contract Personas

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, the student will create some additional Users within Azure AD that correspond to the different user roles within the Blockchain solution. These Users will also be assigned to the different personas within the Azure Blockchain Workbench their roles within the workflow coincide with.

### Task 1: Create Users in Azure AD

1. Login to the Azure Portal at <http://portal.azure.com> using the credentials for your Azure Subscription.

2. Click on the **Directory and Subscription filter** button at the top of the Azure Portal, then select the **Northwind Traders** Azure AD Tenant that was created for this lab.

    ![The Directory + Subscription filter button is highlighted in the top toolbar of the Azure Portal.](images/lab-guide/image58.png "The Directory + Subscription filter button is highlighted in the top toolbar of the Azure Portal")
