# Azure Blockchain

Northwind Traders is the world's largest food and beverage company. The company has a long history of innovation since its founding more than 150 years ago. Over the last few years, Northwind has been increasing their emphasis on tracking their products from the origin of the raw materials all way through the manufacturing process to the consumer. They pride themselves on being able to certify both the origin and delivery of their products with high accuracy.

Jill Anders, the CTO of Northwind Traders has reached out to you to help them build a truly innovative solution to better track their shipments. Jill says, "We need a system that is more secure, more efficient, and will help us lower, not just IT costs, but other costs across the organization." They've heard of Blockchain and Smart Contract technologies, and are thinking these may help them solve this problem.

## Workshop
In this workshop, you will learn how to design a solution with Ethereum Blockchain and several Azure services to collect device telemetry information and enforce contract specifics related to conditions during the transport of goods. 

## Whiteboard Design Session
Students will learn how to build and configure an Internet of Things (IoT) Audit Solution using Azure Blockchain. Students will do this using Ethereum Blockchain with the use of Smart Contracts to collect device telemetry information in addition to enforce contract specifics related to conditions during transport of goods. Specifically, the IoT devices will report temperature and humidity data that will be validated through the Smart Contracts against agreed upon acceptable ranges.

Students will learn how to:

- Deploy and Configure Azure Blockchain Workbench

- Write and Deploy Ethereum Smart Contracts with Solidity

- Integrate both IoT and Blockchain together into a single solution
